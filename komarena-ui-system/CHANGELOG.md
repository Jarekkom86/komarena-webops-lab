# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Replaced hardcoded shop, cart and ReSmart service destinations with WooCommerce-derived URLs and audited canonical fallbacks.
- Sent product search to the verified shop archive and removed unsupported `SearchAction` structured data.

- Updated the footer returns link to the audited canonical `/reklamacie-a-vratenie/` URL.
